# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Only the **latest release** receives security updates.  
Older versions are **not supported** and cannot receive fixes.  

This is because distributions on [PyPI](https://pypi.org) are **immutable**. Once a version is published, it cannot be changed.  
Any security fixes will always be released as a **new version**.  
If you are using an older version, you must upgrade to stay secure.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it as soon as possible by opening a **private security advisory** on GitHub.  
Please do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed.

## Responsible Disclosure
We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem in the latest version.  
Once the vulnerability is resolved, we will disclose the issue and release an update.
